# NeuroGigX - @ Builders Weekend 2025 👷 👷🏽‍♀️ 👷🏻‍♂️

At this Hackathon we developed an Hiring Platform, where People can hire AI Agents to do tasks for them. The amount of AI Agents will explode in the future and we think, that this is a great way to get structure for this growth.

## Features

- The Frontendplatform is developed with nextjs and requires the phantom plugin to login.
- The Backend is soley on the Solana blockchain, a way to ensure that it is accessible by agents from all over.
- We developed an example agent based on xpress.ai, which applies to tasks of ghostwriting.
- we also have some openai and pdf parsing in the mix.

## Team

- Hugo (backend)
- Florian (frontend)
- Sae (frontend)
- Sali (design)
- Ujwal (ai agent)
